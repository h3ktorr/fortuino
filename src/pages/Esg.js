      <h2>Esg Integration</h2>
      <p>ESG integration is the practice of incorporating material environmental, social and governance ESG information or
        insights alongside traditional measures into the investment decision process to improve long term financial outcomes of
        portfolios. Unless otherwise stated in Fund documentation or included within the Fund's investment objective, inclusion
        of this statement does not imply that the Fund has an ESG-aligned investment objective, but rather describes how ESG
        information is considered as part of the overall investment process.
        <br/><br/>
        The Global Allocation Investment Team believes that a company’s ability to manage material environmental, social and
        governance “ESG” issues may be essential to the company’s ability to sustain growth and generate value for
        shareholders over the long term, and thus ESG performance indicators are considered as part of our investment process.
        For long-term investors like Global Allocation, incorporating ESG information into its research and investment decisions
        has been, and remains, very important to our fundamental investment process and our goal of seeking to maximize
        risk-adjusted returns.
        <br/><br/>
        The team analyzes ESG data when conducting research and due diligence on new investments, and when monitoring existing
        investments within the portfolio. The team’s ongoing monitoring of the portfolio involves regular portfolio risk reviews
        with the Risk and Quantitative Analysis group. These reviews include discussion of the portfolio's exposure to material
        ESG risks, as well as exposure to sustainability-related business involvements, climate-related metrics, and other
        factors.
